            <h1 id="world-of-warcraft-addons">World of Warcraft AddOns</h1>
<p>I played World of Warcraft for far too long and wrote a bunch of small addons for it (this was how I started programming).</p>
<p>In no particular order:</p>
<h2 id="-ickd-https-github-com-imjoehaines-ickd-"><a href="https://github.com/imjoehaines/ickd">ickd</a></h2>
<p>ickd is a really simple to do list addon. It stores individual to do lists per character and does nothing else.</p>
<p>I wrote it because, despite there being a bunch of different addons for note taking, all of them had a bunch of extra features added on top. I prefer using small programs that do one thing well than giant ones that has way more functionality than I need, so I wrote my own.</p>
<h2 id="-supt-https-github-com-imjoehaines-supt-"><a href="https://github.com/imjoehaines/Supt">Supt</a></h2>
<p>One of my biggest pet peeves when I played WoW was people who used interrupt announcers. These addons made a player say when they interrupted a spell but in the vast majority of situations this information was just unnecessary, so I wrote Supt which does not announce interrupts to other people. Instead it displays a message on a player&#39;s screen when they successfully interrupt a spell, to help them keep track of when they&#39;re actually interrupting things.</p>
<h2 id="-resty-https-github-com-imjoehaines-resty-"><a href="https://github.com/imjoehaines/Resty">Resty</a></h2>
<p>In WoW a raid group has only a certain number of ressurections they can use in combat. Resty is a tracker for this number and includes a countdown until the next one is ready.</p>
<h2 id="-aunty-https-github-com-imjoehaines-aunty-"><a href="https://github.com/imjoehaines/aunty">Aunty</a></h2>
<p>Aunty is a taunt announcer. It reports whenever people use a spell that taunts an enemy (forces them to focus on the caster) as in some scenarios this can have a detrimental affect on other players and in others it is important to know who is currently being attacked.</p>
