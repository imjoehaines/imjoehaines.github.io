<p>This was my final year University project &mdash; an app to teach basic music theory for the bass guitar. Some very basic knowledge is assumed as the app is intended as a learning aid and is <em>not</em> a replacement for more detailed lessons.</p>
<p>It has 3 exercises:</p>
<h3 id="notes-on-the-fretboard">Notes on the Fretboard</h3>
<p>This exercise randomly selects a fret and asks which note it is. Make a selection with the buttons at the bottom and the app will grade your performance.</p>
<h3 id="intervals">Intervals</h3>
<p>This exercise randomly selects an interval from the root note (highlighted in red). Make a selection by clicking or tapping on a fret marker.</p>
<h3 id="scales">Scales</h3>
<p>Select the desired scale and key from the settings page and the exercise will randomly select a note &amp; interval in that scale. Choose the correct position of this note by clicking or tapping on a fret marker. The root note in the scale is highlighted in red.</p>
