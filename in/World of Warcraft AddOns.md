# World of Warcraft AddOns

I played World of Warcraft for far too long and wrote a bunch of small addons for it (this was how I started programming).

In no particular order:

## [ickd](https://github.com/imjoehaines/ickd)

ickd is a really simple to do list addon. It stores individual to do lists per character and does nothing else.

I wrote it because, despite there being a bunch of different addons for note taking, all of them had a bunch of extra features added on top. I prefer using small programs that do one thing well than giant ones that has way more functionality than I need, so I wrote my own.

## [Resty](https://github.com/imjoehaines/Resty)

In WoW a raid group has only a certain number of ressurections they can use in combat. Resty is a tracker for this number and includes a countdown until the next one is ready.

## [Supt](https://github.com/imjoehaines/Supt)

One of my biggest pet peeves when I played WoW was people who used interrupt announcers. These addons made a player say when they interrupted a spell but in the vast majority of situations this information was just unnecessary, so I wrote Supt which does not announce interrupts to other people. Instead it displays a message on a player's screen when they successfully interrupt a spell, to help them keep track of when they're actually interrupting things.

## [Aunty](https://github.com/imjoehaines/aunty)

Aunty is a taunt announcer. It reports whenever people use a spell that taunts an enemy (forces them to focus on the caster) as in some scenarios this can have a detrimental affect on other players and in others it is important to know who is currently being attacked.
